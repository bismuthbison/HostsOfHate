# Hosts of Hate
## About
This is a project to do research on various hate groups and websites. Right now research and notes on these site will be recorded in markdown and added to the host files.  I am working on a classification category system and classification as well for social networks. The is an addenum to existing block lists that are provided by Steven Black's Host List.
## How to use
This is not for ISPs since that would go in the face of net neutrality, this is for work places, cafes, homes, schools or people that just want to know. 

## Isn't this a morality policing
Well that is up to you, you can use the list or not. [Steven Black Host's](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) website is the same concept. It blocks Porn, Gambling, Social, Fakenews etc on moral grounds. I would like to think that this does the same, but about something important. I just like to show my research here. 

## Why is this taking so long?
I am just one guy with RL duties, maybe the team will grow. I don't know. This is also started as a way to teach myself Git to host documentation. 

## Where are the sites in the research?
Most of the raw data will be in the Mark Down Front Matter. Some markdown viewers hide this.
