# Hosts of Hate
## About
This is a project to do research on various hate groups and websites. Right now research and notes on these site will be recorded in markdown and added to the host files.  I am working on a classification category system and classification as well for social networks. The is an addenum to existing block lists that are provided by Steven Black's Host List.
## How to use
This is not for ISPs since that would go in the face of net neutrality, this is for work places, cafes, homes, schools or people that just want to know.
